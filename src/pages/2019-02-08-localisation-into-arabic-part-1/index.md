# Software localisation into Arabic Part 1

If you want to be successful online, you need to design for good user experience. That means if you are creating a website for Arab users, you need to apply UX and usability considerations that are specific to your target audience in that region.

A great user experience will make users return to your website or app. If the experience is poor, they simply won't.

Arabic is the fifth most widely spoken language throughout the world. It's mostly spoken in the Middle East and North Africa. It is one of the oldest languages and is the official language in 26 countries. However, it is very under represented when it comes to the internet.

The written word is always going to be the backbone of any website or application. When users find it difficult to understand the content of your website or app, they will become frustrated and dissatisfied.

Arabic tends to be a more 'wordy' language than English. Often certain English words or phrases cannot be translated into Arabic directly and they have to be described rather than translated word by word. This can lead to problems when there is only limited space available, e.g. on a mobile screen.

It is also important to remember that there is no single form of Arab culture and language. There are three forms of Arabic: Classical or Qur’anic Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and Spoken or Colloquial Arabic.

Modern Standard Arabic derives from classical Arabic. It is the language that is taught in schools and universities and it is used in news media, literature, science and technology and for administrative purposes across North Africa and the Middle East. This language is a written language only and can be perceived as quite formal.

If your website or application uses quite a formal tone overall, this might be the language to use for your translations. If on the other hand you are using a more chatty tone, then translation will be a lot harder because there are various forms of spoken Arabic. Some of these dialects are similar while others are mutually incomprehensible.

Deciding on the form of Arabic you use will be influenced by a number of different factors:

* -- Are your target users based in a single country or are you targeting the whole region?
* -- Do you have the resources and capabilities to have your website or application cater to local dialects?
* -- What’s the tone of voice that you want your website or application to convey?

It’s important to fully understand who your target users are and then make your decisions accordingly.
