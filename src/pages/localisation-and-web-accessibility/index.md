Web accessibility means that websites and tools are designed and developed so that anybody even if they have any disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with  and contribute to the web. Web accessibility is also beneficial for people without disabilities.

For example, a key principle of web accessibility is designing web sites and software that are flexible
enough to meet different user needs, preferences, and situations. Sometimes such flexibility
also benefits people using a slow internet connection or people with "temporary disabilities", such as a broken arm, and people with changing abilities due to aging.

Internationally, a number of initiatives such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have been implemented to develop guidelines for web accessibility to generate content that is usable by everybody.

The WCAG guidelines aim for perceivability, understandability, operability and robustness. Here are some of the things that can be done to improve the accessibility of a website.

## Perceivability

+ Provide captions, text or other alternatives for non-text content.
+ Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning.
+ Make it easier for users to see and hear content.

## Understandability

+ Make text readable and understandable.
+ Make content appear and operate in predictable ways.
+ Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

## Operability

+ Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
+ Make it easy to use inputs other than keyboard.
+ Help users navigate and find content.
+ Give users enough time to read and use content.
+ Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions.

All these guidelines can be found with detailed descriptions on the [W3 website] (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#ensure-compat "W3 website").
