Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
contribute to the Web

When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them.

Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society.

Internationally, a number of initiatives such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have been implemented to develop guidelines for web accessibility to overcome this problem.
